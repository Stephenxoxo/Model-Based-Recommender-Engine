# Model-Based-Recommender-Engine
I created a book Recommender System using Sci-kit learn's N-neighbours algorithm for my model and the streamlit library to deploy it as a web app. 

The dependencies needed are python, streamlit, sklearn, and numpy.

# Installing dependencies
Run the line below to install streamlit :
```
pip install streamlit
```
To install sklearn :
```
pip install sklearn
```

Pandas and Numpy would be installed alongside sklearn.

> Happy Testing!!
