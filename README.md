# Model-Based-Recommender-Engine
I created a book Recommender System using Sci-kit learn's N-neighbours algorithm for my model and the streamlit library to deploy it as a web app. 

The dependencies needed are python, streamlit, sklearn, and numpy.

# Installing dependencies
Run the line below to install streamlit and sklear :
```
pip install streamlit sklearn
```

Pandas and Numpy would be installed alongside sklearn.

To run the code, first cd into the cloned directory
```
cd Model-Based-Recommender-Engine
```

Then run the python file using streamlit.
```
streamlit run KNN_app.py
```

> Happy Testing!!
